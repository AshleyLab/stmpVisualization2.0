# stmpVisualization
This project has two distinct code components.  The first is a .py script that reads stmp annotation data in from the annotation tsv file and processes it into input data for the visualization.  The second is a Processing (a java extension language) script that renders the drawing and provides interactive curation workflow.  
The Processing component can be run either with the processing file (a '.pde' environment file) or with an exported java app version of the script.  Processing must run locally--as such the design of the project involves remotely mounting the data stored on sherlock.
