# Demos

These demos are intended to demonstrate how to load this library in various
ecosystems.  The library is designed to be used in the web browser and in node
contexts, using dynamic feature tests to pull in features when necessary.  This
works extremely well in common use cases: script tag insertion and node require.

Systems like webpack try to be clever by performing simple static analysis to
pull in code.  However, they do not support dynamic type tests, breaking
compatibility with traditional scripts.  Configuration is required.  The demos
cover basic configuration steps for various systems and should work as laid out.
